Enable Wifi in App Mode
=======================

On the GoPro Hero3 White there is no easy way to press the Wifi button via
software using the `t app key` command.

Using the `t app key` command it is possible to navigate the user menu.

The navigation steps can be figured out from the manual and/or by observing the
steps on a fully functional camera, like
