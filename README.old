Scripts for GoPro HERO2, HERO 3, HERO3+, HERO 2014. Some other Ambarella-based cameras are supported, such as Mobius, DJI Vision, etc... 

Just download the autoexec.ash file you will find in the folders and save the file in the root of the SD, insert SD back and turn on the camera, the hack will execute on boot. This is like some 80s autorun DOS fun hacking. Just in the XXI century.

It supports all the GoPro HERO cameras (see list), but, some commands work with certain cameras:
* <b>t app</b>: works with HERO3 Black, HERO3+Black, HERO3+Silver
* <b>t gpio</b>: works with HERO3 Silver, White and HERO2
* <b>reboot yes and non-t commands</b>: all cameras
* GoPro HERO4 supports linux commands and custom A9 commands
